# Littlecow

Littlecow is an open-source system and chrome extension which allows anyone with a Google account to earn money by browsing websites. For every website you visit, the Littlecow extension gets the site code and sends it to MovingLake's servers.
At the end of the month MovingLake calculates the total revenue from these datasets and sends back to littlecow contributors money in the form of ethereum tokens.

## Privacy

Users are opted-out by default from sending private data but can choose to do so. Users earn more money if they send private data. But for users who do not want to send private data, we dynamically load 
javascript query selectors to select only the public pieces of a specific set of websites.
